##What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
git fetch and git merge. I am used to just using git pull so I was a little unsure of what git fetch and git merge were useful for.

##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The above -- git fetch/git merge were clarified.

##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked about the process of using git fetch and git merge and how it related to git pull.

##What still confuses you about git?
I know there is a lot more to git than what I have learned so far. I am not too confused about anything as of now but then again I have not gone too in depth with git yet.

##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I had a positive experience in my first GPS. Both the guide and my partner offered positive feedback which made working with them a breeze.
