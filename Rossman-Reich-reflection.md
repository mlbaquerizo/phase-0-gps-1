#Reflection

What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I had never actually used git fetch / merge (I usually just pulled from the origin straight away) --- it was good to review those. I also had some config problems in my terminal I had to quickly work through. So now I think I am more comfortable with some of the git config commands :)

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Git fetch / merge (see above!)

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

Again: git fetch / merge (;))

What still confuses you about git?

I don't think I am confused about anything we have practiced so far on git. I get that merge conflicts can really blow up when you have a ton of people working in the same repository. I am worried that one day working with tons of people on git will lead to some confusion (but I suppose I will deal with that when it happens!)

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

Great! I felt super bad b/c my device wasn't working great and it made us start late (sorry Matthew!) but otherwise it was all smooth sailing!
